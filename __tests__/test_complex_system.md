# Testing Complex System Blog Post Generation

This file contains test cases for the blog post generation related to complex systems.  We'll focus on ensuring the markdown output is correctly formatted and contains the expected content for a blog post about building a complex system using a specific framework.  For this example, we'll use React.


## Test Case 1: Basic Structure

**Expected Output:**  A markdown file containing a title, introduction, sections on architecture, implementation details (including code snippets), challenges faced, and conclusions.  The React framework should be explicitly mentioned throughout.

**Test:**  Check for the presence of the following elements:

*   A title (e.g., "Building a Complex System with React")
*   An introduction explaining the purpose and scope of the system.
*   A section detailing the system architecture (e.g., using diagrams or textual descriptions).
*   At least one section describing the implementation of a key component using React.  This should include code snippets properly formatted using markdown code blocks (```jsx ... ```).
*   A section discussing challenges encountered during development.
*   A concluding section summarizing the project and its outcomes.

**Example Snippet (Expected in the generated markdown):**

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch data...
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Render data */}
    </div>
  );
}
```


## Test Case 2:  Handling of External Resources

**Expected Output:**  Correctly formatted links to external resources (e.g., documentation, libraries) should be included within the markdown.

**Test:** Check for the presence of properly formatted links using markdown syntax (`[Link Text](URL)`).  Verify that these links point to valid and relevant resources.


## Test Case 3:  Code Snippet Formatting

**Expected Output:**  All code snippets should be correctly formatted using markdown code blocks with appropriate language highlighting (e.g., `jsx`, `javascript`, `css`).

**Test:**  Verify that all code snippets are enclosed within triple backticks (`````) and that the language is specified (e.g., ````jsx`).  Check for proper syntax highlighting.


## Test Case 4:  Image Inclusion

**Expected Output:**  If images are used to illustrate the system architecture or other aspects, they should be correctly included using markdown image syntax (`![Alt Text](image.jpg)`).

**Test:** Check for the presence of image links and verify that the image paths are correct (relative or absolute paths).


## Future Test Cases:

*   Testing for consistent formatting and style.
*   Testing for the presence of headings and subheadings.
*   Testing for the use of lists and other markdown elements.
*   Testing for proper grammar and spelling.


This test file will be updated as the blog post generation improves and more complex features are added.
