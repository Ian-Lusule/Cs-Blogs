# Testing Novel Solution Blog Post:  A Faster Fibonacci Sequence Calculation

This file contains tests for the blog post explaining a novel solution to calculating the Fibonacci sequence.  The blog post itself will be in `github-markdown-cs-blog/posts/novel_solution.md`.  These tests ensure the code examples within the blog post function correctly and that the explanations are accurate.

## Test Cases

The blog post will present a novel approach to calculating Fibonacci numbers, focusing on efficiency improvements over naive recursive or iterative methods.  The tests below cover various aspects of this approach:

**1. Correctness:**

* **Test Case 1:**  Verify that the function returns the correct Fibonacci number for small inputs (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 10).
* **Test Case 2:**  Verify that the function returns the correct Fibonacci number for large inputs (e.g., 50, 100), demonstrating the efficiency gains.
* **Test Case 3:**  Handle edge cases such as negative inputs (expecting an error or specific handling).


**2. Efficiency:**

* **Test Case 4:**  Measure the execution time of the novel solution for large inputs and compare it to a naive iterative approach.  This test should demonstrate a significant performance improvement.
* **Test Case 5:**  Measure the memory usage of the novel solution for large inputs and compare it to a naive recursive approach.  This test should demonstrate reduced memory consumption.


**3. Robustness:**

* **Test Case 6:**  Test the function with various data types as input (e.g., floats, strings - expecting appropriate error handling).
* **Test Case 7:**  Test the function's behavior under high load conditions (e.g., calculating multiple Fibonacci numbers concurrently).


## Test Implementation (Example using Python and pytest)

```python
import pytest
from fibonacci_novel_solution import fibonacci_novel  # Import the function from the blog post's code

def test_fibonacci_small_inputs():
    assert fibonacci_novel(0) == 0
    assert fibonacci_novel(1) == 1
    assert fibonacci_novel(2) == 1
    assert fibonacci_novel(3) == 2
    assert fibonacci_novel(10) == 55

def test_fibonacci_large_inputs():
    assert fibonacci_novel(50) == 12586269025
    # Add more large input tests as needed

def test_fibonacci_negative_input():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):  # Expecting a ValueError for negative input
        fibonacci_novel(-1)

# Add tests for efficiency and robustness as described above.  These will require timing and memory profiling libraries.

```

**Note:**  This is a template.  Replace `fibonacci_novel_solution.py` and the assertions with the actual implementation and expected outputs from your novel Fibonacci solution.  You'll need to add more comprehensive tests based on the specifics of your algorithm.  The efficiency tests will require using Python's `time` module or a more sophisticated profiling tool.  Remember to adapt this structure and the test cases to match the content and code examples in your blog post.
